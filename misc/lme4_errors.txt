the last being an update needed for Matrix 1.0-13.

The detailed logs are now at http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary.html in the fedora-gcc (and fedora-clang) columns.

We had pending submissions for boss and changePower, and have now sent these back for corrections.  (We also had one for robustlmm but that has been rather overtaken by events.)

R2STATS blme cplm influence.ME mixAK pedigreemm spacom

are installation failures, and ChainLadder depends on cplm, geospacom on spacom.

In addition,

RLRsim languageR metafor texreg

are showing missing objects from lme4;

BradleyTerry2 HLMdiag afex

have ::: calls to lme4 objects now exported;

MuMIn has
Missing or unexported object: 'lme4::formula'

MEMSS multcomp robustlmm

have different output to their .save files.

----------------------------

Both BioC packages depending on lme4 fail (and this we leave to you).

Uwe has Windows binaries up now (for R-devel).

We will now start reporting to the maintainers, asking for an update before Sept 27 at about which time we intend to move 1.0 to the main area.

We noticed that 3 of your[*] packages need updates, MEMSS, SASmixed and mlmRev.  So please update as soon as possible.

[*] the lme4 authors. (As far as we can tell: they have no named maintainer.)
